# Traffic-Flow-Prediction-System
Developed a predictive system to forecast traffic flow patterns using historical traffic data.

# Traffic Flow Prediction System

## Overview
The **Traffic Flow Prediction System** is a Python-based solution designed to analyze historical traffic data and forecast traffic flow patterns. This system uses advanced time-series forecasting techniques and machine learning models to enable urban planners and transportation authorities to optimize traffic operations and manage congestion effectively.

The project includes a modular and scalable pipeline for data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, predictions, visualization, and automation.

## Key Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Loads and preprocesses traffic data from public APIs and IoT-enabled sensors.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, removes outliers, and standardizes timestamps.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes traffic patterns, peak hours, and seasonal trends.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates lag-based, temporal, and categorical features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Training**: Trains ARIMA and LSTM models for short-term and long-term predictions.
- **Visualization**: Generates visual comparisons of actual and predicted traffic flows.
- **Automation**: Automates data ingestion, model retraining, and prediction updates for real-time operation.
